/*
	Two Way Adapter Pattern
	-----------------------
	While implementing Adapter pattern, there are two approaches – class adapter and object adapter – however both these approaches produce same result.
	
	Class Adapter – This form uses java inheritance and extends the source interface, in our case Socket class.
	Object Adapter – This form uses Java Composition and adapter contains the source object.
