/**
 * Deadlock in java is a part of multithreading. Deadlock can occur in a situation when a thread is waiting for an object lock, 
 * that is acquired by another thread and second thread is waiting for an object lock that is acquired by first thread. 
 * Since, both threads are waiting for each other to release the lock, the condition is called deadlock.
